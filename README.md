# Knapsack-Shopping

Algorithm to solve the knapsack and shopping spree problems implemented in Python

Knapsack problem: 
Given two integer arrays val[] and wt[ ] which represent values and weights associated with n items respectively and an integer W which represents knapsack capacity, determine the maximum value subset of val[] such that sum of the weights of this subset is less than W

Shopping Spree:
If a family wins a shopping spree each person in the family can take any itemsin the store that he or she can carry out (they each have a carrying capacity), however each person can only take one of each type of item. Determine the maximum total price of items for each family and the items
that each family member should select

Shopping.txt is formatted as follows:
- First line is the number of test cases
- Second line is the "n" number of items in that test case
- Next "n" lines are each item's value and weight
    - 30 45 means the value is 30 and the weight is 45
- Next is the number of people in the family
- Then the maximum weight that can be carried
- Repeat for however many test cases
